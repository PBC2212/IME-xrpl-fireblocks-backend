🧩 Business Model
Component	Description
Users	Pledge real-world assets (e.g., real estate, metals, vehicles) and receive tokenized RWA tokens.
Swap Facility	Enables these RWA tokens to be swapped for XRP/USDT at a platform-controlled rate (e.g., 70% of appraised value).
Liquidity Source	Aggregated from existing XRPL DEX liquidity, third-party LPs, or auto-sourced via aggregators like Hummingbot.
Revenue	Platform charges a 1–3% fee per swap + optional appraisal or tokenization fees.
Custody	No custody of funds needed; tokens remain in user wallets until atomic swap confirmation.
Compliance	KYC/AML optional but can be implemented via 3rd-party plug-ins.

🔁 Swap Flow (Value-for-Value)
User pledges real-world asset via IME Oracle → mints 1:1 RWA token.

User connects wallet to Swap UI and selects token to swap.

Oracle verifies asset and discount % (e.g., 70%).

User signs transaction: RWA Token → Platform

Platform signs transaction: XRP/USDT → User

XRPL executes atomic swap with both tokens + platform fee.

Funds routed to user; platform receives RWA token and keeps fee.

🧠 Example: Real Estate Swap
Real Estate Value	$100,000
RWA Token Minted	100,000 rPROP
Platform Swap Rate	70%
Swap Amount	70,000 USDT
Platform Fee	1.5% = 1,050 USDT
Final Received	68,950 USDT

🔒 Security & Compliance
✅ XRPL native atomicity ensures swap finality

🔐 Optional Fireblocks custody + signature flow
